# About CodeTrace

CodeTrace is an AI-powered "Frontend Forensic" tool designed to simplify the debugging process for developers.

### The Problem
When a bug is reported via a video recording, developers often spend significant time manually tracing the visual behavior back to the specific lines of code responsible.

### The Solution: CodeTrace
CodeTrace uses the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model to:
1.  **Watch**: Analyze the visual symptoms in your bug reproduction video.
2.  **Read**: Scan your codebase to find related logic and components.
3.  **Resolve**: Pinpoint the exact file and line number causing the issue and provide a corrected code snippet.

### Mission
To make debugging as simple as recording a video, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than hunting bugs.
